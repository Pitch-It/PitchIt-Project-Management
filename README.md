## About
Introducing Pitch It, a fullstack web-app built using React, Express, and PostgreSQL. Pitch it allows users to create projects, pitch their ideas to other developers, and recruit other developers based on their skillset. We spent a ton of time working on creating a program that is modular and easy to improve on for future iterations/changes.

npm install

npm start
